<summary>Scenario 1: Connecting to Virtual Machines over the Internet</summary>

#### Task 1: Connect to 3 Virtual Machines
1. Navigate to the Virtual Machine tab to see the Virtual Machines available.
2. Click on Dodgy-Science to view the VM, and click on 'Connect'.
3. You will now see the Public IP address associated with that Virtual Machine. Click on 'Download RDP File' and open the file once it's downloaded.
4. Once you open the RDP file and click Connect, you will need to provide the Username and Password (If you are unsure of the Username/Password, click on Password Reset on the VM in the Azure Portal to reset the password). 
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> - The reason Users will be reporting issues with connecting to the Virtual Machines will be because some of the Virtual Machines will NOT have a Public IP address. So right now, they won't be able to be connected to over the Internet via RDP.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Scenario 2: Ensuring Virtual Machines can be connected to via RDP</summary>

#### Task 1: Identifying affected Virtual Machines
1. To make sure all of the Virtual Machines are able to be connected to over the Internet via RDP, you need to investigate what VM's do NOT have a Public IP address assigned to them. Navigate to the Virtual Machine tab to view the Virtual Machines available.
2. Check the Virtual Machines avaialble and check to see if there is a Public IP address listed against the Virtual Machine. If there is not, make a note of the Virtual Machine.

#### Task 2: Attaching Public IP's to Virtual Machines
1. Go to the Azure portal and log in. In the left navigation pane, click on "Virtual machines" and select Your VM.
2. Click on the virtual machine to which you want to attach a Public IP address, and click on Network Settings
3. Under Essentials, search for 'Public IP Address' and click on 'Configure' to setup a Public IP address.
4. Click on the existing NIC (Or click 'Add' if one is not present and complete the on-screen steps) to edit the IP Configuration.
5. Check the 'Public IP Address' box
6. Under 'Public IP address' either select a pre-existing Public IP address to use, or click on 'Create a Public IP Address' to set one up. If you click on 'Create a Public IP Address' you will be prompted to provide a name, and to select a SKU (Basic/Standard). Once done, click OK and Save.
7. The VM will now have a Public IP assigned to it, and you can now connect to it vis SSH/RDP.

<b>NOTE</b> - If you are unable to connect to the VM using the Public IP, check to make sure that the Network Security Group associated with the VM has an Inbound Rule to allow traffic from the Internet over Port 3389.
