Choose "Custom DNS" and specify the Azure DNS server addresses.
Save the changes to apply the custom DNS settings.
Scenario 6: Implement Service Endpoints

Objective: Enable service endpoints for Azure Storage on the "data" subnet within the "neu_vnet" virtual network.
Steps:
Locate the "neu_vnet" virtual network in the Azure portal.
Navigate to the "Subnets" section and select the "data" subnet.
Enable service endpoints and select Azure Storage from the list of available services.
Save the changes to enable service endpoints for Azure Storage.
Scenario 7: Implement User-Defined Routes (UDRs)

Objective: Create a user-defined route table named "custom-routes" and associate it with the "uks_vnet" virtual network to define custom routing.
Steps:
Find the "uks_vnet" virtual network in the Azure portal.
Choose "Routes" and then "Create Route Table".
Configure the route table settings, including routes and next hops.
Associate the route table with the "uks_vnet" virtual network.
Save the changes to apply the user-defined routes.
Scenario 8: Configure VPN Diagnostics

Objective: Enable VPN diagnostics for the "vpn-gateway" in the "uks_vnet" virtual network to monitor VPN connections.
Steps:
Locate the "vpn-gateway" resource in the Azure portal.
Choose "Diagnostics settings" and then "Turn on diagnostics".
Configure the diagnostics settings, including storage account and retention policy.
Save the changes to enable VPN diagnostics.
Scenario 9: Implement Network Watcher

Objective: Create and configure a Network Watcher instance named "network-watcher" to monitor and diagnose network issues.
Steps:
Navigate to the Azure portal and search for "Network Watcher".
Choose "Create" to deploy a new Network Watcher instance.
Configure the instance settings, including region and resource group.
Once deployed, access the Network Watcher instance and configure monitoring and diagnostic settings as needed.
Scenario 10: Implement Azure Firewall

Objective: Deploy an Azure Firewall instance named "azure-firewall" in the "uks_vnet" virtual network to control and inspect network traffic.
Steps:
Locate the "uks_vnet" virtual network in the Azure portal.
Choose "Firewalls" and then "Add Azure Firewall".
